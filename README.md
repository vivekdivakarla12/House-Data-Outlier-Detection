# House-Data-Outlier-Detection
Finding outliers in house prices and understanding what features contribute to housing prices

### Initial outlier finding and visualizations
Using Isolation forest to find outliers in housing prices, and plotting the data compared to the other prices.

- Graph 1 shows date on the X-axis vs Price, with the red dots shown as the outliers. 
- Graph 2 shows longitude and latitude for all of the houses, and the orange dots are shown as the outliers. This is an interesting visualization as many of the outliers are all grouped together in a similar area of the map
